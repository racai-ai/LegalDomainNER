# LegalDomainNER

This repository contains relevant code and resources for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Romanian legal domain.
The resources available here are in addition to the LegalNERo corpus (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4772094) and to other resources available in the RELATE platform (https://relate.racai.ro).

A NER application used to train different models is available in its own repository: https://github.com/racai-ai/RNER
